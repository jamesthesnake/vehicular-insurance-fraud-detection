# Detecting Vehicular Insurance Fraud with Unsupervised Learning

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to detect fraudulent claims in vehicular insurance. Utilizing advanced machine learning models, we aim to identify anomalous patterns that signify fraudulent activities within claim data.

## Requirements

This project requires:
- Python 3.9
- [Poetry package installer](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

Ensure you have these installed before proceeding with the setup.

## Setup

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies and Create .env File**: Run `make install`
2. **Kaggle API Key**: Go to the [Kaggle settings page](https://www.kaggle.com/settings), generate an API token, and copy the token valyes into the `.env` file. This step is necessary for accessing the Kaggle dataset.

## Run

To run the project, simply execute the following command: `make run`
This will start a Jupyter notebook server, allowing you to open and run the notebook files in your project.
